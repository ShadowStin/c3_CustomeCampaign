		<title>Sarmizegetusa Regia</title>
		<subtitle>Dacian Provinces</subtitle>
        <text> @G[c3 stills_107.png]@L 
		@H Historical Background @L
		Sarmizegetusa Regia was a capital of Dacian and Getae tribes prior to its conquest during the reign of Emperor Trajan. It has always been a defensive area for a settlement in the hills of Dacia, modern day Romania. The city was established from a past Roman military camp in 102 AD but Dacians managed to besiege and destroy it only a couple of years after in 106 AD. @L@L
		Romans returned soon after to recolonize the area when the Dacian attacks subsided. The terrain and underdeveloped infrastructure required Romans to erect bridges and build roads. @L@L
		As an example of how a Roman army of this period could be defeated, the Battle of Teutoburg Forest will be mentioned. @L@L
		Germans knew the Roman tactics since their leader was a traitor who deserted Rome. Additionally, the Roman army in question was complacent and did not properly scout ahead. This allowed the Germans to ambush the overconfident Romans in the forested hillsides. Overlooking a path where the army would travel, they would launch hit and run attacks making good use of projectiles to inflict losses. Instead of trying to win one decisive battle, they would skirmish and retreat when the Romans recovered from the initial shock. This battle was a series of skirmishes that took part over several days. @L@L
		At dusk, the weakened Romans would set up a fortified encampment and were ambushed while work was being done. This led to a total defeat of the forces present and those who surrendered were massacred, with even some of the captured officers burned alive in a ritual sacrifice. @L@L
		
		@G[c3 instructions icon.png]
		@H Instructions @L
		Governor, the new assignment is already waiting for you. You are to establish a Roman colony in Dacia in the old Roman camp near the enemy capital known as Sarmizegetusa. This will prove important as Dacians are a fierce warrior tribe that did not yet fully relinquish its claims on the province. Use the additional starting funds provided to quickly establish legions as the enemy activity is in motion as we speak. @L@L
		Sarmizegetusa will provide you with a new challenge. Thus far you could always rely on the plentiful trade within the empire to sustain your city and provide employment for your people. This will not be possible, as trade routes are few and riddled with banditry. @L@L
		An industrious governor would seek friendship amongst the local people who live there in high enough numbers to perhaps offset the lack of exports. Access to luxury goods will also prove challenging, as the local climate does not suit the cultivation of vines or olives. @L@L
		The city itself is to be built with the usual splendor. Regardless of the terrain difficulties or expense involved, Sarmizegetusa must flourish. We need to show the Dacians what a true Roman city looks like. @L@L
		Do not underestimate the enemy. They might be barbarians, but their military tactics and multiple angles of attack will prove difficult to handle.@L@L
		
		@H Edicts @L
		@Dangerous @Trade @Routes - There are common trade problems, and quotas are not as high to fully support the city. Trading with the natives is recommended. @L@L
		@Dacia - High military activity is expected. Trade interruptions will be reduced if your city builds a Grand Temple to Mars. @L@L
		
		@H Additional Information @L
		Native traders can be very effective but require a proper setup. Once a native meeting hut gets visited by a missionary, they will send out a carter that will aim for the closest warehouse with any goods that are designated as exports, regardless of value. The faster you can make the carter return to the meeting hut, the faster he will spawn again. Note that natives need land traders to be allowed in a warehouse to interact with it, but they will buy anything set for export, even if sold only via sea trade route. @L@L
		@H Persistent Events @L 
		Grand Temple to Mercury unlocks plaza. Subsidies, lasting until 10 prosperity rating, give 100 dn. per month. Workshops only unlock after the subsidy expires. @L@L
		Due to game limitations, starting prices for goods will be adjusted after 1 in-game month has passed. @L@L@L@L

		<title>(!) Lake Fish (!)</title>
		<subtitle>Ceres Demands Sacrifice</subtitle>
		<text> @G54 @L 
		@H Message @L
		Governor, the local lake contains abundant healthy fish. The problem is that the lake is deep, and fish rarely come to the surface where they could be harvested easily. If we were to construct a grand shrine to the goddess Ceres, with her blessing we may command her powers to our benefit and use this important food source. @L@L
		@G[decorative objetive .png] @H New Side Objective @L
		Build a Grand Temple to Ceres to make fish locally available. @G[gt_ceres_med.png] @G[decorative objetive .png] @L@L@L

		<text> @G[c3 stills_146.png]@L
		Governor, we've been approached by the locals. They already enjoy some of our goods and would wish to buy even more. To not lose face amongst their people, we would need to show commitment to their peoples by constructing them mausoleums to bury their dead chieftains in. @L@L
		@G[decorative objetive .png] @H New Side Objective @L
		Constructing 10 small mausoleums will unlock the southern trade area with the natives. @G[mausoleo.png] @G[decorative objetive .png] @L@L@L
		@H Historical Background @L
		Dacians are considered a subgroup of the wider Thracian peoples but as with everything to do with the Balkans, the situation is complicated. Slavs only migrated to the area later and thus, Dacian peoples were more closely related to the Greeks and the Scythians. @L@L
		Culturally, the origins of their people go back to the early Bronze Age. Alexander the Great led one of his first campaigns against the Dacians in the Carpathian Mountains. @L@L@L@L

		Truly a splendid performance governor. With Sarmizegetusa as a pillar of Roman culture, our foothold in Dacia is secured. @L@L
		I'm in dire need of your services back in Brittania, though, Lindum will no doubt prove your most challenging military assignment! @L@L

		@H Message @L
		Governor, the local banditry is damaging our economy; traders do not feel safe on the roads in and out of Sarmizegetusa. Establishing a Grand Temple to Mars would help to show the locals that Rome will stop at nothing to succeed here. @L@L
		@G[decorative objetive .png] @H New Side Objective @L
